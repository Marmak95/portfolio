                                    <p>Mobile cloud gaming (MCG) is an innovative approach delivering on-demand video games by
                                        leveraging cloud technologies, effectively minimizing power consumption and hardware costs.
                                        However, ensuring a high Quality of Service (QoS) for smooth gameplay and a high Quality of
                                        Experience (QoE) for users presents a significant challenge. This study focuses on investigating
                                        the impact of network conditions on users' QoE while playing MCG. A testbed was created, involving
                                        participants playing Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) via Steam Remote Play on a smartphone.
                                        Overall, this research sheds light on the critical role of network conditions in MCG, emphasizing
                                        the need for continued improvements in QoS to ensure a seamless gaming experience.</p>

                                    <p>This project, a part of a bachelor's degree project in Industrial Design Engineering at
                                        Luleå University of Technology, focuses on improving the work environment for Modul's
                                        welding department.
                                        The project, conducted in three stages, examined challenges through study visits,
                                        interviews, and observations.
                                        The analysis led to five concepts, aiming to optimize layouts, reduce noise, and
                                        enhance ergonomics.
                                        The final suggestions include workstation rotation, lighting improvements,
                                        and ergonomic seating.</p>

                                    <p>This was a collaborative group project for Polarfönster, a swedish window manufacturing company,
                                        where our focus was on enhancing the production system and work environment.
                                        By conducting a detailed analysis of the layout, we reorganized workstations and equipment
                                        placement to create a more streamlined workflow.
                                        We also presented improved inventory management suggestions by reducing the in-process inventory for reduced lead times.
                                        More suggestions were improved transportation routes for material flow optimization and reducing handling time.
                                        In terms of the work environment, we implemented ergonomic workstations, improved lighting,
                                        and maintained a clean and organized workspace.
                                        These improvements led to increased production efficiency, reduced lead times,
                                        and improved employee satisfaction, positioning Polarfönster for continued success
                                        in the competitive window manufacturing industry.
